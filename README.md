## Introduction

This project is a test bed for building and experimenting with reusable UI components. We are leveraging the power of Next.js, DaisyUI, and TailwindCSS to create a flexible and modern front-end setup. While the main focus is on component development, the routes in this project are private and contain sensitive information.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast and scalable web applications.
- **DaisyUI**: A component library for TailwindCSS that provides beautifully designed and easy-to-use UI components.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: Experiment with building and using reusable components.
- **Private Routes**: All routes in this project are private and contain sensitive data.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js, DaisyUI, and TailwindCSS for a powerful development experience.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smicapplab/next-tailwind-daisy
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
